# TTS Enhancements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Multi-Agent Observability System's TTS (Text-to-Speech) capabilities across various Claude Code hooks to provide more intelligent, context-aware voice announcements.

## Implemented Enhancements

### 1. PreToolUse Hook Enhancement
**File**: `.claude/hooks/pre_tool_use.py`

- **Complex Operation Detection**: Identifies Task delegation, long-running operations, and risky commands
- **Proactive Warnings**: Announces operations before they start with duration estimates
- **Risk Awareness**: Warns about potentially dangerous operations (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, etc.)

Example announcements:
- "Starting complex task: Review code for security vulnerabilities. Estimated time: 10 to 30 seconds"
- "Warning: Risky operation detected. Deleting directory /important/data. Please ensure you have backups"

### 2. Audio Overlap Prevention
**File**: `.claude/hooks/utils/tts/simple_lock_coordinator.py`

- **File-based Locking**: Prevents multiple TTS messages from playing simultaneously
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Works even when the TTS queue coordinator isn't running
- **Timeout Protection**: Prevents indefinite lock holding with 5-second timeout

### 3. PostToolUse Intelligence Upgrade
**File**: `.claude/hooks/post_tool_use.py`

- **Success Milestone Detection**: Celebrates build successes, test completions, deployments
- **Error Pattern Detection**: Tracks repeated errors and suggests fixes after 3 occurrences
- **Bulk Operation Summarization**: Intelligently summarizes large operations

Example announcements:
- "Build completed successfully in 12.5 seconds"
- "All 156 tests passed"
- "This error has occurred 3 times. Consider checking file permissions or running with elevated privileges"

### 4. SubAgent Integration
**File**: `.claude/hooks/subagent_stop.py`

- **Context-Rich Announcements**: Different messages based on agent type (code reviewer, test runner, debugger, etc.)
- **Quantitative Results**: Includes specific numbers (files reviewed, tests passed)
- **Duration Information**: Reports how long operations took

Example announcements:
- "Code review completed for 5 files in 45 seconds"
- "All 156 tests passed"
- "Debugger found and fixed issues in 2.0 minutes"

## Testing
All enhancements have been thoroughly tested with comprehensive test scripts:
- `test_pre_tool_use.py`: Tests complex operation detection
- `test_post_tool_use.py`: Tests success milestones and error patterns
- `test_subagent_stop.py`: Tests context-rich announcements

## Integration Points
- Uses the existing `coordinated_speak.py` for queue-based TTS
- Falls back to simple lock coordinator when queue isn't available
- Integrates with observability system for event logging
- Respects TTS_ENABLED environment variable
- Personalizes messages with ENGINEER_NAME

## Production Ready
All enhancements are fully integrated and production-ready, providing intelligent voice notifications throughout the Claude Code workflow.
